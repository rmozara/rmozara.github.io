# rmozara.github.io

Welcome to my personal workspace and digital archive. Here, I collect essays, research notes, and creative explorations — reflecting ongoing studies in science, philosophy, and Integral Yoga. This site is both a notebook and a library, evolving as I do.

## Technology

Built with **static HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript** — no frameworks, no CMS, no build steps. This keeps the site **fast, independent, and future-proof**. The modular layout is designed for easy maintenance and adaptability.

## Design Philosophy

The design follows a **quiet, stable rhythm** — minimal distractions, generous margins, and consistent proportions. Every page adheres to the same grid and type hierarchy, using a **system-UI font stack** for clarity and familiarity. Colors are restrained; focus remains on content and flow.
